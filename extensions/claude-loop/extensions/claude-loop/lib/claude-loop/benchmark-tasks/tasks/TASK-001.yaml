title: Optimize Token Usage in Vision Processing
description: |
  Remove unnecessary vision bytes from API calls to reduce token usage in vision processing.
  Current implementation sends full resolution images which consume excessive tokens.
  Implement image compression/resizing before API calls to reduce token consumption by at least 30%.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "Image preprocessing function implemented that resizes images before API calls"
  - "Token usage reduced by at least 30% compared to baseline"
  - "Visual quality remains acceptable for the use case"
  - "Unit tests added for image preprocessing function"
  - "Documentation updated with token optimization strategy"

context:
  background: "Vision API calls consume significant tokens due to image data. Current implementation sends full-resolution images unnecessarily."
  constraints:
    - "Must maintain visual quality sufficient for the task"
    - "Preprocessing should not add significant latency"
    - "Solution should be configurable (compression level, target size)"
