title: Add Dependency Graph Analyzer (Medium)
description: |
  Create a module to analyze dependency graphs from PRD user stories.
  Detect circular dependencies and suggest optimal execution order.
  Visualize dependency graph using ASCII art or GraphViz.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "DependencyGraph class with add_dependency() and detect_cycles() methods"
  - "Cycle detection using depth-first search"
  - "Topological sort for execution order"
  - "ASCII art visualization of dependency graph"
  - "Suggest parallel execution groups"
  - "Unit tests cover various graph structures"
  - "Documentation includes graph algorithms explanation"

context:
  background: "Medium complexity requiring graph algorithms and visualization."
  constraints:
    - "No external graph libraries (implement DFS/topological sort)"
    - "ASCII visualization should fit in 80 columns"
    - "Handle disconnected graphs"
