## Data Files

All `.json` files contain structured data for programmatic access:
- Citation databases for reference management
- Comparison matrices for analysis
- Configuration specifications for implementation

## Usage

To regenerate any output, run the corresponding research story:

```bash
# Regenerate literature survey
./run-scwm-research.sh --story RS-001

# Regenerate entire milestone
./run-scwm-research.sh --milestone week1

# Full research run
./run-scwm-research.sh
```

## Quality Metrics

Each output includes:
- **Confidence Score**: 0-100 rating of finding reliability
- **Source Count**: Number of sources consulted
- **Fact-Check Status**: Whether findings were verified
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp of generation
