## Template Variables

The following variables are available for template rendering:

- `{{question}}` - The main research question
- `{{timestamp}}` - Report generation timestamp (UTC)
- `{{source_count}}` - Number of sources used
- `{{confidence_score}}` - Overall confidence score (0-100)
- `{{confidence_level}}` - Human-readable confidence level
- `{{findings}}` - List of key findings
- `{{gaps}}` - List of identified gaps
- `{{conflicts}}` - List of conflicts
- `{{sources}}` - List of source dictionaries

## Appendix

### Methodology

This report was generated using the Research Loop synthesis pipeline:

1. **Question Decomposition**: The main question was broken into sub-questions
2. **Multi-Agent Research**: Specialist agents gathered findings from diverse sources
3. **Synthesis**: Findings were combined, deduplicated, and analyzed
4. **Gap Analysis**: Missing information and conflicts were identified
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Overall confidence was calculated based on multiple factors

### Confidence Score Factors

- **Source Count**: More sources increase confidence (diminishing returns)
- **Source Agreement**: Multiple perspectives agreeing increases confidence
- **Recency**: Recent sources score higher
- **Authority**: Known authoritative sources score higher
- **Gaps Penalty**: Each gap reduces confidence
- **Conflicts Penalty**: Unresolved conflicts reduce confidence

### Citation Format

Inline citations use numerical references: [1], [2], etc.
Full source information is provided in the Sources section.
