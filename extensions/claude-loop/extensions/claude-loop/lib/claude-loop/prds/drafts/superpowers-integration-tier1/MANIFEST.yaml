title: "Superpowers Integration - Tier 1 Critical Path"
status: draft
created: 2026-01-15
author: claude-loop-analysis
version: 1.0

description: >
  Integrate critical learnings from Superpowers project into claude-loop:
  mandatory skill enforcement, SessionStart hooks, interactive design refinement,
  two-stage review system, and TDD enforcement. Expected impact: setup friction
  ↓ 80%, quality consistency ↑ 60%, wasted work ↓ 50%.

tags:
  - superpowers-integration
  - quality-improvement
  - workflow-enhancement
  - user-experience

priority: high
estimated_impact: critical

objectives:
  - Reduce setup friction by 80% (zero commands to start)
  - Increase quality consistency by 60% (mandatory workflows)
  - Reduce wasted work by 50% (interactive design validation)
  - Improve success rate by 35% (two-stage review, TDD enforcement)

dependencies:
  - claude-loop v3.0 (Phase 3 complete)
  - Python 3.10+
  - pytest for testing

related_docs:
  - docs/analysis/superpowers-comparison-upgrade-proposal.md
  - docs/features/session-hooks.md
  - docs/features/mandatory-skills.md
  - docs/features/brainstorming.md
  - docs/features/two-stage-review.md
  - docs/features/tdd-enforcement.md
  - docs/features/execution-modes.md

success_criteria:
  - All 8 user stories completed and tested
  - Tests pass with > 80% coverage
  - Documentation complete
  - Zero regressions in existing functionality
  - Positive user feedback on new workflows

rollout_plan:
  phase_1: "SessionStart hooks and skill enforcement (Week 1)"
  phase_2: "Quality gates: two-stage review and TDD enforcement (Week 2)"
  phase_3: "Interactive design refinement (Week 3, if time permits)"
  phase_4: "Configuration and integration testing (Week 2-3)"

risks:
  - Risk: Increased complexity may confuse users
    Mitigation: Clear documentation, gradual rollout, good defaults
  - Risk: Mandatory workflows may feel restrictive
    Mitigation: Configuration options, mode selection (interactive/autonomous/hybrid)
  - Risk: Breaking changes to existing workflows
    Mitigation: Comprehensive testing, migration guide, backward compatibility

notes: >
  This PRD implements Tier 1 (critical path) recommendations from the
  Superpowers comparison analysis. Tier 2 and Tier 3 recommendations
  will be addressed in follow-up PRDs based on success of Tier 1 implementation.
