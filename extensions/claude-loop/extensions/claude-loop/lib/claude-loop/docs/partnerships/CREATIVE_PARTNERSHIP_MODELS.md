# Creative Partnership Models: "Seller Financing" for Academic Partnerships

*The art of getting value without upfront capital*

---

## The Core Insight

In real estate, **seller financing** lets buyers acquire property by paying the seller over time instead of needing a bank loan upfront. The seller gets:
- Higher total return (interest)
- Ongoing relationship with buyer
- Asset still working for them during payment period

We can apply similar creative structures to academic partnerships.

## Model 1: "Sweat Equity" Partnership

**Concept:** Trade engineering time for partnership value

### Pitch to Stanford AIMI:
```
"Instead of $25K, I'll build you a Medical Research Adapter worth $50K+
in engineering time. You get a working tool, I get partnership access."
```

### Structure:
| You Provide | They Provide |
|-------------|--------------|
| 200 hours engineering (3 months part-time) | Partnership status |
| Medical Research Adapter for AIMI | Access to seminars/events |
| Open-source tool they can showcase | Faculty introductions |
| Maintenance for 1 year | Co-authorship on paper |

### Why It Works:
- **For AIMI:** They get custom tooling worth more than $25K
- **For You:** You were building this anyway; now it has a home
- **Risk Mitigation:** Deliverable-based, not cash-based

### Email Template:
```
Subject: Proposal: Build AIMI a Custom Research Tool (Instead of Affiliate Fee)

Dear Johanna,

I'm the founder of research-loop, an open-source multi-agent research system.
Rather than the standard $25K affiliate fee, I'd like to propose an alternative:

I'll build AIMI a custom Medical Research Adapter - integrating PubMed,
ClinicalTrials.gov, and FDA databases - specifically designed for health AI
literature review automation.

In exchange, I'd ask for:
- Affiliate-equivalent access to seminars and events
- Introduction to 2-3 faculty working on research automation
- Opportunity to co-present the tool at an AIMI event

The tool would be open-source, MIT-licensed, showcasing AIMI's commitment
to accessible research infrastructure.

Would you be open to discussing this?

## Model 2: "Revenue Share" Partnership

**Concept:** Pay when you get paid

### Structure:
```
Year 1: $0 upfront
Year 2: 10% of research-loop revenue (if any), capped at $25K
Year 3: Standard affiliate fee OR continued revenue share
```

### Why It Works:
- **For AIMI:** They're investing in a startup; upside if you succeed
- **For You:** No cash outlay until you have revenue
- **Alignment:** Their incentive is to help you succeed

### Pitch:
```
"I can't pay $25K today, but I can pay $25K over time as I generate revenue.
If research-loop succeeds, you'll get your fee. If it doesn't, you've lost
nothing but gained a tool and a relationship."
```

## Model 3: "Grant Proxy" Partnership

**Concept:** Let a Stanford professor apply for grants; you provide the tool

### How It Works:
1. Find Stanford professor interested in research automation
2. They apply for HAI-AIMI joint grant ($50-100K)
3. Grant funds their research + your tool development
4. You become "industry collaborator" on the grant

### Benefits:
| Party | Gets |
|-------|------|
| Professor | Grant funding, novel research tool, publication |
| You | Funding for development, Stanford affiliation, co-authorship |
| AIMI | Research output, tool they can showcase |

### Finding the Right Professor:
Look for faculty publishing on:
- Systematic review automation
- AI for literature search
- Research reproducibility
- Meta-research / science of science

### Pitch to Professor:
```
"I've built a research agent system with the first comprehensive benchmark
(ResearchBench). I'd like to collaborate on a paper and potentially a grant
proposal. You bring domain expertise and Stanford affiliation; I bring
working software."
```

---

## Model 4: "Pilot Program" Partnership

**Concept:** Free trial that converts to paid

### Structure:
```
Months 1-6: Free pilot with 2-3 AIMI researchers
Month 6: Review results, testimonials, usage data
Month 7+: Convert to paid affiliate OR continue free if high impact
```

### Pitch:
```
"Let me prove value before you ask for commitment. Give me access to 3
researchers for 6 months. If research-loop saves them 100+ hours, we
discuss formal partnership. If not, no obligation."
```

### Why It Works:
- **Low risk for AIMI:** They're just trying a tool
- **High upside for you:** Testimonials, case studies, refined product
- **Natural conversion:** Success creates its own demand

---

## Model 5: "Open Source Champion" Partnership

**Concept:** Become AIMI's open-source success story

### Structure:
```
You: Release ResearchBench as "Stanford AIMI ResearchBench" (co-branded)
They: Feature you in their open-source initiatives, no fee required
```

### Why This Works:
- Universities love open-source wins (good PR, mission-aligned)
- ResearchBench is genuinely novel (first research agent benchmark)
- Co-branding gives them credit for enabling innovation
- You get Stanford association without paying

### Pitch:
```
"ResearchBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating research
agents - 500 questions across 5 domains. I'd like to release it as
'Stanford AIMI ResearchBench' in collaboration with your center.

You'd get:
- Credit for enabling novel benchmark
- Visibility in AI research community
- Tool your researchers can use

I'd get:
- Stanford association
- Access to your research community
- Feedback to improve the benchmark"
```

## Model 6: "Sponsored Research" Flip

**Concept:** Get a company to sponsor your AIMI affiliate fee

### How It Works:
1. Find company that would benefit from research-loop
2. They pay your AIMI affiliate fee ($25K)
3. In exchange, they get:
   - Early access to research-loop
   - Custom adapter for their domain
   - Co-branding on outputs

### Target Companies:
- **Biotech/Pharma:** Would love automated clinical literature review
- **Investment Firms:** Would pay for better research tools
- **Tech Companies:** Building their own agents, want benchmarks

### Pitch to Sponsor:
```
"For $25K, you get:
- research-loop access for 1 year
- Custom adapter for [your domain]
- Stanford AIMI association (credibility)
- First look at ResearchBench results in your domain

The $25K goes to Stanford, not me - it's basically a tax-deductible
donation that gets you a research tool."
```

## Model 7: "Deferred Payment" Partnership

**Concept:** Pay the $25K, but later

### Structure:
```
2026: $0 (provisional affiliate)
2027: $12.5K (half fee)
2028: $25K (full fee) + $12.5K backpay
```

### Pitch:
```
"I'm pre-seed with strong technical validation but no revenue yet.
Can we structure payment over 3 years? I'm committed to the partnership
long-term; I just need the cash flow flexibility of a startup."
```

### Why It Might Work:
- Universities have discretion on payment terms
- They'd rather have engaged affiliate on payment plan than no affiliate
- Shows long-term commitment

---

## Model 8: "Research Credit" Partnership

**Concept:** Pay in compute/API credits instead of cash

### If You Have:
- Anthropic API credits
- Cloud compute credits
- Any transferable tech resources

### Pitch:
```
"I have $X in [cloud/API] credits that might be useful for AIMI researchers.
Would you consider trading affiliate access for these resources?"
```

## Recommended Approach: Stack Multiple Models

**Phase 1 (Now):**
1. Email Johanna Kim with **Model 1 (Sweat Equity)** proposal
2. Simultaneously reach out to professors for **Model 3 (Grant Proxy)**
3. Publish ResearchBench with AIMI co-branding offer (**Model 5**)

**Phase 2 (If Phase 1 works):**
1. Build Medical Research Adapter as promised
2. Collect testimonials from researchers
3. Apply for formal affiliate with **Model 4 (Pilot → Paid)** argument

**Phase 3 (When Funded):**
1. Convert to standard affiliate fee
2. Or continue creative arrangement if both parties prefer

---

## Key Negotiation Principles

1. **Lead with value, not ask:** "Here's what I can build for you" not "Can I have access?"

2. **Make it easy to say yes:** Propose specific, low-risk first step

3. **Align incentives:** Their success = your success

4. **Create urgency without pressure:** "I'm building this anyway; partnership just makes it better for both of us"

5. **Have a BATNA:** "If this doesn't work, I'll partner with Berkeley/MIT instead" (don't say this, but know it)

---

## The Ultimate Pitch

```
"I'm not asking you to give me something for nothing.

I'm proposing a trade:
- I build you a Medical Research Adapter worth $50K+ in engineering time
- You give me affiliate-level access worth $25K

You come out ahead financially.
I come out ahead relationally.
AIMI gets a showcase open-source tool.
Researchers get a working tool for literature review.

Everyone wins. The only question is: do you want to win together?"
