# Email Draft: Stanford AIMI Partnership Proposal

**To:** Johanna Kim, MBA, MPH (AIMI Executive Director)
**Email:** aimicenter@stanford.edu
**Subject:** Proposal: Open-Source Research Tool for AIMI (from Yale/Genentech alum)

---

Dear Johanna,

I'm Dr. Paul Jialiang Wu — LLM Architect Manager at Accenture, former Principal Data Scientist at Genentech, and Yale postdoc in computational immunology. I'm building research-loop, an open-source multi-agent system that automates literature review and research synthesis.

Given my background at the intersection of AI and biomedical research, AIMI's mission resonates deeply. I'd like to propose a creative partnership.

**What we've built:**

- **ResearchBench**: The first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI research agents (500 questions across 5 domains) — we'd like to release this as "Stanford AIMI ResearchBench" if you're interested in co-branding
- **51% improvement** in research quality via meta-learning (Contextual Experience Replay), measured through rigorous A/B testing
- **Multi-source synthesis** from arXiv, Semantic Scholar, PubMed with sentence-level citations and confidence scoring
- **Human-in-the-loop checkpoints** for high-stakes domains — critical for medical research

**My proposal (instead of the $25K affiliate fee):**

I'd like to build AIMI a custom **Medical Research Adapter** — integrating PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and FDA CDRH databases — specifically designed for health AI literature review automation. This would include:

- Specialized agents: Clinical Evidence Reviewer, Regulatory Tracker, Safety Signal Monitor
- Medical-specific quality gates (peer review status, trial phase verification)
- Open-source release under MIT license, showcasing AIMI's commitment to accessible research infrastructure

In exchange, I'd ask for:
- Affiliate-equivalent access to seminars and events
- Introduction to 2-3 faculty working on research automation or systematic reviews
- Opportunity to present the tool at an AIMI seminar or event

**Why this makes sense for AIMI:**

- You receive a custom tool worth $50K+ in engineering time
- AIMI researchers get automated literature review capability
- ResearchBench co-branding gives AIMI credit for enabling a novel benchmark
- Everything stays open-source, aligned with academic values

**Alternatively**, I'd welcome:
- A pilot program with 2-3 AIMI researchers to prove value before any formal commitment
- Introduction to faculty who might be interested in grant collaboration (I provide tool, they apply for HAI-AIMI joint funding)

I'm registered for the January 27th Grand Rounds and would love to connect in person or via a brief call beforehand.

Would you have 15 minutes in the coming weeks to discuss?

Best regards,

## Follow-up Strategy

**If no response in 7 days:**
Send brief follow-up referencing Grand Rounds attendance

**If positive response:**
- Schedule 15-min call
- Prepare live demo
- Have Medical Research Adapter scope document ready

**If "we only do standard affiliates":**
- Ask about pilot program option
- Ask for faculty introductions for grant collaboration
- Attend free events, build relationships organically
