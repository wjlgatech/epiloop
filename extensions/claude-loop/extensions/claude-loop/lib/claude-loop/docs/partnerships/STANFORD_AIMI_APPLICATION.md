## Product Description

### claude-loop
An infrastructure layer for autonomous AI agents that provides:
- Context management beyond token limits via story-based task decomposition
- File-based persistent memory across sessions
- Automatic failure classification (95% accuracy)
- Human-gated self-improvement system
- Quality gates and verification pipelines

### research-loop (Built on claude-loop)
A multi-agent research system that coordinates specialized AI agents to:
- Decompose complex research questions
- Search and synthesize from multiple sources (arXiv, Semantic Scholar, Exa.ai)
- Verify claims with fact-checking agents
- Generate confidence-scored research reports
- Learn from outcomes via Contextual Experience Replay (CER)

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **ResearchBench** - First comprehensive benchmark for research agents (500 questions, 5 domains)
2. **Meta-learning** - CER provides 51% improvement on research tasks
3. **Domain Adapters** - Specialized for AI-ML research and investment research
4. **Human-in-the-loop** - Mandatory checkpoints for high-stakes domains

## Relevance to AIMI's Mission

### Alignment with Health AI

While our current adapters focus on AI-ML and investment research, the architecture is domain-agnostic. We plan to develop a **Medical Research Adapter** that could:

1. **Literature Review Automation**
   - Search PubMed, bioRxiv, clinical trial registries
   - Track SOTA in specific medical AI domains (radiology, pathology, etc.)
   - Synthesize findings with citation accuracy

2. **Clinical AI Model Evaluation**
   - Benchmark medical imaging models against standard datasets
   - Track FDA approvals and regulatory pathways
   - Monitor real-world performance vs. published results

3. **Research Collaboration Support**
   - Accelerate systematic reviews
   - Identify collaboration opportunities across institutions
   - Track funding opportunities in health AI

### Specific AIMI Synergies

| AIMI Research Area | research-loop Contribution |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Medical imaging AI | Automated literature tracking, benchmark monitoring |
| Clinical deployment | Regulatory pathway research, real-world evidence synthesis |
| AI safety in healthcare | Fact-checking, source verification, confidence calibration |
| Multi-modal learning | Cross-domain research synthesis |
