## The Challenge

Stanford AIMI Startup Affiliate Program costs **$25,000/year** - not feasible for a bootstrapped pre-seed startup.

## Alternative Strategies

---

### Strategy 1: FREE Stanford AIMI Engagement (No Fee Required)

### Strategy 4: Stanford HAI Seed Grants (For Research Collaboration)

**Find a Stanford Faculty Champion**

| Program | Details |

**How It Works:**
1. Identify Stanford professor working on AI research agents
2. Propose collaboration: they apply for grant, you provide tool
3. You get access, they get research-loop capabilities

**Potential Champions to Contact:**
- Stanford HAI faculty in NLP/agents
- AIMI researchers doing systematic reviews
- Anyone publishing on research automation

### Strategy 5: Direct Outreach to AIMI Leadership

**Email Template to Johanna Kim (AIMI Executive Director):**

```
Subject: research-loop: Open-Source Research Agent for Health AI

Dear Johanna,

I'm Wu, founder of research-loop - an open-source multi-agent research
system with the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating research
agents (ResearchBench: 500 questions, 5 domains).

We've built:
- 51% improvement via meta-learning (measured via A/B testing)
- Multi-source synthesis (arXiv, Semantic Scholar, PubMed)
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints for high-stakes domains

We're developing a Medical Research Adapter specifically for health AI
literature review automation - directly aligned with AIMI's mission.

I'd love to:
1. Demo research-loop for your team (15 minutes)
2. Discuss potential research collaboration opportunities
3. Contribute to AIMI's open-source initiatives

Would you have 15 minutes in the coming weeks?

Best regards,
Wu

**Goal:** Relationship first, affiliate status later (or never needed).

### Strategy 6: NSF SBIR/STTR Grants

**[NSF AI Funding](https://www.nsf.gov/focus-areas/ai)**

| Program | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **SBIR Phase I** | $275,000 for R&D |
| **STTR** | Requires academic partner (AIMI?) |
| **Focus** | Translate research into products |

**Fit:** research-loop + ResearchBench is exactly the kind of AI infrastructure NSF funds.

---

### Strategy 7: Industry Partnerships (Free/Low Cost)

| Partner | What They Offer | Action |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| **Exa.ai** | Already integrated, possible startup credits | Email for startup program |
| **Semantic Scholar** | Free API, Allen Institute connection | Request higher rate limits |
| **LangChain** | Open source community, visibility | Contribute integration |
| **Hugging Face** | Hub hosting, community | Publish ResearchBench |

---

## Recommended Action Plan

### Week 1 (Immediate)
1. ✅ Register for Stanford AIMI Grand Rounds (Jan 27, 2026)
2. ✅ Email Johanna Kim with introduction
3. ✅ Apply to BAIR Grant program
4. ✅ Apply to AI2 Incubator

### Week 2-4
5. Research Stanford faculty for potential grant collaboration
6. Publish ResearchBench on Hugging Face (visibility)
7. Submit to LangChain integrations

### Month 2-3
8. If BAIR/AI2 interested: pursue formal partnership
9. If Stanford relationship develops: revisit affiliate option
10. Consider NSF SBIR if validation strong

## Key Insight

**You don't need $25K to engage with Stanford AIMI.**

The affiliate fee buys:
- Priority access to faculty
- Formal partnership status
- Recruitment pipeline

But you can get 80% of the value through:
- Free events and seminars
- Direct faculty relationships
- Research collaboration proposals
- Open-source contributions

**Build the relationship first. The formal partnership follows when you have traction (and funding).**
