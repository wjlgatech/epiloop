# Claude-Loop: One-Pager for Partners

## The Problem (30 seconds)
AI coding assistants hit context limits. A 200K token window can't hold a large codebase. Every session starts from scratch. Complex features still require weeks of human work.

## The Solution (30 seconds)
**Claude-Loop** breaks features into small stories, completes one per iteration, and persists memory through files. Like a relay race—each runner hands off the baton perfectly.

## The Demo (60 seconds)
We asked Claude-Loop to build its own monitoring system:
- **Input:** 6 user stories in a JSON file
- **Output:** Complete monitoring with dashboard, cost tracking, HTML reports
- **Time:** 40 minutes, fully autonomous
- **Cost:** ~$3 in API costs

## The Vision (60 seconds)

| Phase | Timeline | Capability |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Done** | Now | Autonomous code features with specialist agents |
| **Building** | 30 days | Web dashboard + Computer-use (GUI automation) |
| **Next** | 60 days | End-to-end: Idea → Deploy, zero human steps |

## Why Now? (30 seconds)
- Claude's 200K context + tool use = first time this is possible
- Anthropic's safety focus = enterprise-ready
- Open source = community compounds our advantage

## The Ask
- **Pilot:** Deploy on one project, measure ROI
- **Partner:** Shape the roadmap for your industry
- **Invest:** Own a piece of the future
