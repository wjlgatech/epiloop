# Chat Channels

Epiloop can talk to you on any chat app you already use. Each channel connects via the Gateway.
Text is supported everywhere; media and reactions vary by channel.

## Supported channels

- [WhatsApp](/channels/whatsapp) — Most popular; uses Baileys and requires QR pairing.
- [Telegram](/channels/telegram) — Bot API via grammY; supports groups.
- [Discord](/channels/discord) — Discord Bot API + Gateway; supports servers, channels, and DMs.
- [Slack](/channels/slack) — Bolt SDK; workspace apps.
- [Google Chat](/channels/googlechat) — Google Chat API app via HTTP webhook.
- [Mattermost](/channels/mattermost) — Bot API + WebSocket; channels, groups, DMs (plugin, installed separately).
- [Signal](/channels/signal) — signal-cli; privacy-focused.
- [BlueBubbles](/channels/bluebubbles) — **Recommended for iMessage**; uses the BlueBubbles macOS server REST API with full feature support (edit, unsend, effects, reactions, group management — edit currently broken on macOS 26 Tahoe).
- [iMessage](/channels/imessage) — macOS only; native integration via imsg (legacy, consider BlueBubbles for new setups).
- [Microsoft Teams](/channels/msteams) — Bot Framework; enterprise support (plugin, installed separately).
- [Nextcloud Talk](/channels/nextcloud-talk) — Self-hosted chat via Nextcloud Talk (plugin, installed separately).

- [Zalo Personal](/channels/zalouser) — Zalo personal account via QR login (plugin, installed separately).
- [WebChat](/web/webchat) — Gateway WebChat UI over WebSocket.

- DM pairing and allowlists are enforced for safety; see [Security](/gateway/security).
